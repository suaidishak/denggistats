This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
state.map <- subset(mysadmin, mysadmin$NAME_1 == "Kedah")
state.point <- stars_master_data[stars_master_data$State == "KED",]
g <- ggplot() +  geom_polygon(data=state.map, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group))
g <- g +  geom_point(data=state.point, aes(x=lon, y=lat), color="red")
g
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
